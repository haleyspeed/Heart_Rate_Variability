# Heart_Rate_Variability
Takes unlimited channels of EEG, ECG, and EMG activity and determines covariance of brain, respiratory, and cardiac function. 

### Simple Peak/Trough Detection
- AI-lite algorithms to determine threshold for events and event features

### Built-In Functions
- Peak amplitude
- Peak to peak latency within and between channels
- Annotated plots for all analyses
- Feature detection of events
- Running FFT analysis with 8s windows and 50% overlap
- Poincare plots

### Future updates
- Spike coherence across channels
- Peak to trough latency
- Trough amplitude
